This repository demonstrates a common error in Hack programming: a stack overflow caused by an unbounded recursive function.  The `bug.hack` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.hack` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from the lack of a robust base case in the recursive factorial function, leading to excessive recursive calls and ultimately exceeding the runtime's recursion depth limit. The solution demonstrates proper base case handling to prevent the stack overflow.
